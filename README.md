**For a better explanation and implementation of this concept please see my new [repo](https://github.com/sevanspowell/MetalDeferredLightingTutorial) and corresponding [tutorial](http://sevanspowell.net/posts/implementing-deferred-shading-in-metal.html).**

Example implementation of a deferred lighting rendering technique in
Swift using Apple's Metal API. Hacked together from Apple's "Adopting
Metal I: A practical approach to your first Metal app" found
